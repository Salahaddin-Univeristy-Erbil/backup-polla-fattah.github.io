abstract: |
  To collect the handwritten format of separate Kurdish characters, each character has been printed on a grid of 14 Ã— 9 of A4 paper. Each paper is filled with only one printed character so that the volunteers know what character should be written in each paper. Then each paper has been scanned, spliced, and cropped with a macro in photoshop to make sure the same process is applied for all characters. The grids of the characters have been filled mainly by volunteers of students from multiple universities in Erbil.
