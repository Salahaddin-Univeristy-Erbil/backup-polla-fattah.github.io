## Course Description

This course aims to provide a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms and components that modern database management systems rely on to deliver efficient and reliable performance.

The curriculum covers a range of fundamental concepts that are essential to both high-performance transaction processing systems (OLTP) and large-scale analytical systems (OLAP). Students will be exposed to a variety of topics, including database design, query processing and optimization, indexing, concurrency control, and recovery management.

Furthermore, the course emphasizes the importance of both efficiency and correctness in the implementation of these ideas. To facilitate a more hands-on learning experience, all class projects will be centered on real-world in-memory, multi-core database systems, which will enable students to apply the concepts and principles covered in the course to practical scenarios.

Overall, this course is designed for advanced undergraduate students in software engineering who are looking to deepen their understanding of database management principles. Through a rigorous and scholarly examination of these core concepts, students will gain the knowledge and skills necessary to develop and optimize high-performance, reliable database management systems.


## Course Objectives
