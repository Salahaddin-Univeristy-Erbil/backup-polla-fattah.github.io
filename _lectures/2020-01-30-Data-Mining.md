## Course Description

The aim of this module is to give students a firm understanding of the theory underlying the processing and interpretation of visual information and the ability to apply that understanding to ubiquitous computing and entertainment related problems. The module is based around problems so that the technology is always presented in context and during some tutorials students work in groups to design solutions to real world problems using the techniques that they have been taught. In addition, the module has a significant practical component so that students can appreciate how difficult it can be to apply the technology.

## Course Objectives

1. An Introduction to Machine Learning.
1. Understanding how Data mining works
1. Understanding how computers can generate information from data.
1. Comparing different Machine learning algorithms to be able to use the best one for the task on hand.

On successful completion of the module students should be able to demonstrate:

- Identify and implement appropriate solutions to low, mid and high-level Data mining problems.
- Represent problems as mathematical models and apply appropriate machine learning and optimization techniques to solve those problems.
- Apply Data mining algorithms and explain their operation.
- Recommend appropriate statistical representations of static and dynamic objects and apply these to solve detection, classification and/or tracking problems.
