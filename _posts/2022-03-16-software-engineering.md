# Software Engineering Department

In the interview with the KTV [^1] I discussed the history, the mission, and the purpose of [Software Engineering Department](https://colleges.su.edu.krd/engineering/software-engineering-department/){:target="Software"} at [Salahaddin University-Erbil](https://su.edu.krd/){:target="Salahaddin"}. Dr Ibrahim Hamarash has established this department at 2000/2001 with 25 students. The first head of department was Dr Ibrahim himself with the founding teachers of the department Dr Shawbo, Mr Karim, Dr Moaiad.
