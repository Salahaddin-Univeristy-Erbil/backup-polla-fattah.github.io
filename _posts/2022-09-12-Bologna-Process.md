# Bologna Process

Bologna Process[^1] is the pedagogical[^2] method that has been adoptted by most of the Europian Universities. It encourages the credit collection method by the students. Once they fullfill the required ammount of credit points they can graduate from that school. This process has the advantage of giving the flexibility of choosing subjects to the students so they can, with the help of advisors, choose thier learning path and future carrier.

In Kurdistan Region we have started to addopt this process too. Particularily in our department, "Software Engineering department" we are more than enthusiastic for this process as now we can enable our students to choose diffrent pathes for thier carrier by picking among the available subjects so that they can specialise in diffierent fields of software devilopment and engineering.

 However, this change might take some time due to multiple reasons first is purily technical, as every change, there are always obistacles to overcome, percks to understand so that we can implement the process as fully with no problems. There are much training tha thas to happen for the teachers, staff and students. As well as implementing a new software process that supports this kind of semister based credit collection instead of annual passing of the subjects.

 Second issue that we have is the resistance for change. There are other departments and colleges that hate this new process. This hate mostly originates from two sources, first they love the status coue and do not wnat to rome into new territories, second they do not comprehend the benifits of the process for thier college/department and see the old process as more fit for thier needs.

 The third problem with this sestem is resources. By resources I mean more staff, leacturers, lecture rooms and labrotaries. These are essencial for the most important part of the process which is letting students to choos subjects. This means we have to offer more subjects that cover students desiers, this needs more lectueres, then studnets choices might bee disproportionate. This means there will be need for bigger lecture rooms for some subjects. And also we need a more dynamic computer labs that can coope with the changes of the subjects. In my online interview with the prime minister I have addressed some of these issues, and his responce were positive to help us to overcome them.

 So while our enthusiasim in our department might help to adopt this process in a very small scale and limited scope. Hoever for a larger and faster adoption rate, we need a governemtn intervention by dedicating aproperate budget for this implementation and transition from old to the new process. 

 There is no need to wait multiple years to see the advantages of this process as it is obvius from now. The students that are started with the Bologna process, are alredy reporting better satisfaction ratio in the surveys and teacher report higher grades for thier students as they are choosing subjects according to thier pation and abilities.

[^2]: Pedagogy and pedagogue come from the Greek paidos "boy, child" plus agogos "leader." Pedagogy refers to the teaching profession as well as the science of education, for example as a college subject. This might be one reason that the word, pedagogue, is often used for a teacher who is overly interested in rules and details, hence the science of teaching, rather than actually getting through to his or her students.[Source](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/pedagogy#:~:text=synonyms%3A%20didactics%2C%20education%2C%20educational%20activity%2C%20instruction%2C%20teaching).
