## Job Duties

My Main duty was teaching, the subjects that I taught was:

1. Distributed systems for BSc Students.
1. [Computer Vision] for MSc Students.

This opportunity provided me with new connections as we have conducted multiple researches together and published quite few of papers.

## Acquired Experiences

More than experience this kind of visiting lecturer job expands my connections and networks of specialists in the field of computer science and software engineering.

## Why I Left

I have started working at [InfoRR Company](/job/software-consultant) which was a bit demanding job. So I just did not renew my contract as visiting lecturer.
